##### Error Detection and Correctiong using Hamming Code Implementation
To demonstrate how parity checking works using the Hamming method. This program uses 4 individual bits to parity check, and can therefore correct it'sefl in case a bit is lost over transmision.

##### Dependencies
None.

##### Compilation and Execution
You can simply compile the `c` files using the following
```sh
$ make
```
Run the transmit program by 
```sh
$ ./trans
```
After execution, go a head and type your sequence of chars or in other words string that you would like to test
Copy it to clip board and start 'receive' by
```sh
$ ./recv
```
Paste in the sequence of numbers and see that it does in fact work.

##### The End
